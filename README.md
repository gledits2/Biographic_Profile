### Research
I joined the iEco Lab at Temple University (Pennsylvania, USA) in January 2020 to work with the diversity patterns of herpetofauna in the Caribbean. Specifically, I am using a database of species occurrences on the islands of the Caribbean Bioregion to understand how anthropogenic movement of species influences the relationships predicted by island biogeography theory, species coexistence, and patterns of beta diversity.

Broadly I am interested in evolutionary and community ecology. I use species introductions to answer questions about how species and communities respond to anthropogenic disturbance and changes in their environment. In addition, I am interested in understanding how species introductions alter community assembly, species interactions, and patterns of diversity.

### Past Research
**Hawaii VINE Project** 
  - Studied avian community ecology and evolution as well as the Seed Dispersal Networks on the Hawaiian island of Oahu.

**Impacts of Exotic Shrubs on Avian Ecology** 
  - Studied the impacts of shrub homeysuckles (_Lonicera_ spp.) on bird diversity patterns and nesting ecology.

**Using N15 Isotope for Seed Dispersal Research** 
  - Used the nitrogen 15 isotope to track the dispersal of seeds in various systems
