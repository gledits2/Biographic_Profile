I joined the iEco Lab in January 2020 to work on the Caribbean Macrosystems project. Specifically, I am using a database of species occurrences on the islands of the Caribbean Bioregion to understand how anthropogenic movement of species influences the relationships predicted by island biogeography theory, species coexistence, and patterns of beta diversity.

Broadly I am interested in evolutionary and community ecology. I use species introductions to answer questions about how species and communities respond to anthropogenic disturbance and changes in their environment. In addition, I am interested in understanding how species introductions alter community assembly, species interactions, and patterns of diversity.
